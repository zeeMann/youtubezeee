            <p> <p style="color:white;">Books in which man meets woman, man woos woman (or, woman woos man) and man and woman live happily ever after are a dime a dozen. Enjoyable, for sure, but not what you’d call memorable. So, the editors  have come up with a list of 10 novels that tell favorite, and timeless, love stories, each of which goes above and beyond basic romance.</p></div>

                        "A deeply troubling yet poetically beautiful story" (Marie Claire)
                        <br><br>
                        "Evocative, entertaining, sexy and funny; but then Murakami is one of the best writers around" (Time Out)
                        <br><br>
                        "Such is the exquisite, gossamer construction of Murakami's writing that everything he chooses to describe trembles with symbolic possibility" (Guardian)
                        <br><br>
                        "This book is undeniably hip, full of student uprisings, free love, booze and 1960s pop, it's also genuinely emotionally engaging, and describes the highs of adolescence as well as the lows" (Independent on Sunday)
                        <br><br>
                        "Catches the absorption and giddy rush of adolescent love... It is also, for all the tragic momentum and the apparently kamikaze consciousness of many of its characters, often funny and quirkily observed." (Times Literary Supplement)

                A funny and tender coming-of-age story that's also the story of a writer finding her voice...touching and utterly real. (Publishers Weekly (starred review))
                <br><br>
                Authentic dialogue, a remarkable empathy with adolescents and an honest portrayal of young, vulnerable love make this a riveting read. (Lancashire Evening Post)

                <p style="color:white;">Every now and then you stumble across an extraordinary book that at first appears like countless others, but then you read it and are amazed at the treasure hidden within. A Walk to Remember is such a book
                 <br><br>
                 In the prologue to his latest novel, Nicholas Sparks makes the rather presumptuous pledge "first you will smile, and then you will cry," but sure enough, he delivers the goods. With his calculated ability to throw your heart around like a yo-yo (try out
                 <br><br>
                 Like John Irving's A Prayer for Owen Meany, Sparks maintains a delicate and rarely seen balance of humor and sentiment. While the plot may not be the most original, this boy-makes-good tearjerker will certainly reel in the fans. Look for a movie starring beautiful people or, better yet, snuggle under the covers with your tissues nearby and let your inner sap run wild.
                 <br><br>
                 Sparks achieves the unlikely feat of making the predictable enjoyable, especially the faithful recording of period detail

                            The  vampire tale for years arrived in Stephenie Meyer's TWILIGHT, about teenage Bella's chaste romance with a beautiful vampire boy. Their intensely erotic feelings are endangered by more predatory types. Guaranteed to suck in sulky 13+ girls for hours.

                            Will keep readers madly flipping the pages of Meyer's tantalizing debut. Publishers Weekly
