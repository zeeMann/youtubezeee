      <div><p>It’s always difficult to pick out the best books of the year, regardless of genre (it’s even harder to do it for a general list).</p>
        <p> There’s the fear that you’ve missed some under-the-radar gem that you could have plucked from obscurity. But there’s also the worry that you’re giving too much adulation to a popular book that doesn’t necessarily deserve it.
I’ve read quite a few books this year, and I feel comfortable with this list. I think it really shows my personal preferences when it comes to what I read. I love fantastic world-building, and mysteries at the heart of a book. I enjoy learning new things as a result of my reading, whether it’s about other cultures or the scientific implications of the science fiction we read. I enjoy grand stories, with poignant social commentary, that focus in on characters and family. Hopefully you’ll find a little bit of all of that in these books. Without further add, here are  top science fiction and fantasy books of 2017, presented in no particular order.</p></div>

<p><p style="color:white;">Review-</p>
<p><p style="color:white;">Today, Shiva is a god. But four thousand years ago, he was just a man. 1900 BC: the once-proud Suryavanshi rulers of the Meluha Empire are in dire peril. The empire's primary river, the Saraswati, is slowly drying up. There are devastating terrorist attacks from the east, the land of the Chandravanshis - and to make matters worse, the Chandravanshis appears to have allied with the Nagas, an ostracised race of deformed humans with astonishing martial skills. The only hope for the Suryavanshis is an ancient prophecy: when evil reaches epic proportions and all seems lost, a hero will emerge...</p>

On the planet Fortune, tech is low, tensions high, and heroes… unlikely, and none more unlikely than thief-turned-soldier, Gideon Quinn.

Wrongly convicted of treason, Gideon Quinn has spent six years harvesting crystal under the killing suns of the Morton Barrens, until the day a general of the Colonial Corps arrives with an offer of freedom, and the chance to clear his name.

Gideon doesn’t have to think twice, and with his pet draco Elvis on his shoulder he takes 'ship for the city of Nike in search of revenge—and justice. But mostly, revenge.

What he finds is a dodger named Mia, a city steeped in corruption, and a menace at the heart of the Corps which could bring Fortune's new and fragile peace to an explosive end.
And that’s just his first night in town.</p>
