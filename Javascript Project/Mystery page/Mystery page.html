                       And Then There Were None is one of Agatha Christie's best known titles. This crime queen has written mysteries where everyone has done it, the narrator has done it, and the sleuth has done it. So why would readers be shocked to find out that Christie wrote a book where NO ONE had done it. That's because by the end of the book, there's no one left alive to have killed the last suspect.  The set-up is fairly typical. Ten people, all accused of killing innocent people, are stranded on an island where they begin to die one-by-one in keeping with a nursery rhyme. Did they each actually kill someone? Who is killing them one by one? By the end of this 1939 title, all the suspects are dead, killed by an unnamed Mr. UN Owen (unknown). The solution is delivered afterward in a clever twist.  The book also wins the award for the greatest number of offensive titles. It was originally published in England as Ten Little N-words (you get what I mean), then as Ten Little Indians, and then finally And Then There Were <br>
                       Why It Made the List  If you haven't read And Then There Were None, you need to because, it's like only one of the most famous damn mystery books ever written. It's a book where NO ONE seems to have done it, which makes it a first in mystery fiction. <br>
                       Don't bother with the Hollywood versions of the book (though seeing Dion get knocked off early for acting like a hep cat may be worth the rest of the film.) The films leave the last two characters alive, freed from suspicious and rushing off to a happily ever after from the island of corpses 'Read It If You Like' Thrillers, suspense, puzzle plots

            <p style="color:white;">Serial killers to the right of me, cannibals to the left. Stuck in the middle with Clarice. Do I really need to explain this plot to anyone with an Internet connection? The book was a best-seller, and the movie was a blockbuster. It has inspired prequels and sequels, movies and television series. In order to capture a bizarre serial killer, a young, female FBI agent opts to consult with another serial killer, one who cooked and ate his victims. The killer chef agrees to help her on the condition that he can get into her head (brains with eggplant is delicious I've been told.)  This set-up allows the FBI agent to find her killer while having someone else mind fuck her in the process. Not the best way to ensure a long career in law enforcement, but more than adequate for a 300 page book. The movie is a cult classic these days, and it's hard to find a week on cable that doesn't carry it. Haven't read this damn book yet? Stop reading and pick it up already -- you won't be disappointed if you have fraction of liking for mysteries with a serious amount of action and adventure.

                <p style="color:white;">Chandler was a wordsmith, a lyrical writer who put a fresh coat of paint on the dark side of Los Angeles with his descriptions of the city and its residents. The Big Sleep was his first private eye novel and the introduction to Philip Marlowe, the loner private eye with the moral code that kept him apart from the private eyes who had come before him. He was kept apart from the seamy, yet beautifully described city of sin that he operates in. He became the model for every smart-ass, yet lonely private eye for the next 80 years, which makes his entrance into mystery important.  In The Big Sleep, Marlowe is asked by a dying man to stop a case of blackmail. As the corpses start to pile up, Marlowe has to figure out which of the man's two daughters is more involved in the crimes. Of course, all the pretty words don't cover up the few sketchy plot points. When asked about a plot point for the movie version, Chandler said that he didn't know who exactly had killed the chauffeur, but pointed out that it really hadn't mattered much. Given that this was another Bogey and Bacall vehicle, the film was a hit and is still shown on cable today.

It certainly lacks car chases and big explosions, but it remains a critic and reader favorite after all these years. This book always appears on nearly every "best of" lists assembled. So what's the mystery besides how to make dry royal history into a fan favorite? When Inspector Alan Grant is stuck flat on his back, he passes the time by studying the faces of famous portraits brought to him by a friend. He's surprised by his reaction to Richard III, who is often portrayed as a humpbacked devil courtesy of Will Shakespeare.  Of course, the major crime that Richard is supposed to have committed is the murder of the two princes in the Tower of London. His two nephews were sent to the tower for "safety" reasons and never seen again, which calls into question Richard's motives and his safety protocols. However, the crimes against the princes were mentioned for years, bringing into question why the wait? The rumors started after Richard had been paved over in a parking lot and the Tudors, who produced the life affirming Henry VIII, began to trash talk the former king.

                            Some novels just tell a good story while others make the reader think, even when they don't want to. John LeCarre's novel brought a light to the espionage field, where readers were used to our spies being good guys who saved the free world and got laid. The Spy who Came in from the Cold tells a very different story, one where the spies are no better than the people they're spying on. The ideals of democracy and freedom are stepped on by the people who are supposed to be defending these ideals.  The title refers to Alec Leamas who is asked to remain "in the cold" which was the British espionage term for an undercover mission. Leamas' goal is to make the East Germans think that he is defecting and giving them false information about another double spy, in hopes of getting the East Germans to kill him, thereby removing one of their own. The plot is even more confusing as it moves along, each person saying whatever they need to accomplish their ends. The men tasked with saving the world for democracy are more cynical than those at a mid-afternoon strip club. This is a must-read for the effect it had on a nation who thought that gadgets and fornication saved Britain from the likes of Blofeld.
